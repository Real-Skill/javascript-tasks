# Promisify

## Summary

This is promisify standard NodeJS - callback hell.

## Goal 

We've got a working app, but we don't like the hell callback. Please rewrite it to use promises.

There are some tests for the current app in `oldApp.spec.js` file which you can remove once the new app conforms to `app.spec.js`.

## Setup
To install dependencies from package.json:

    npm install

To run tests in development mode:

    mocha --watch

To run jshint and tests:

    npm test

To run jshint and tests with human readable output:

    grunt --force
