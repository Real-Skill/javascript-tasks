# Lodash Number Training

## Summary

These are training tasks for Lodash Number. The exercise consist of a few simple tasks.
You are supposed to implement a method, having only the method name and purpose provided.

## Goal

The tests contain some usage of lodash methods.
Make sure that datasets `app/datasets.js` for each method are correct.

### _.clamp

It clamps number within the inclusive lower and upper bounds.

### _.inRange

It checks if n is between the start and up to, but not including, the end. 
If the end is not specified, itâ€™s set to start with the start then set to 0. 
If the start is greater than the end the params are swapped to support the negative ranges.

### _.random

It produces a random number between the inclusive lower and upper bounds. 
If only one argument is provided a number between 0 and the given number is returned. 
If floating is true, or either lower or upper are floats, the floating-point number is returned instead of the integer.
