# Grunt tasks

## Summary
Grunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects. Grunt and its plugins are installed and managed via `npm`, the Node.js package manager.

Your job is to create three grunt tasks responsible for:

* validate files with JSHint,
* run unit tests,
* inject bower plugins directly into the `index.html` file.

At the beginning application is in not working state.

## Goals

After installing appropriate grunt plugins, configure `Gruntfile.part.js` (as it was `config` passed to `grunt.initConfig(config)`) file and create three tasks:

* **wiredep** task:

    * should inject bower dependencies directly into the `index.html` file,
    * for the `bootstrap` component inject only the CSS part

* **jshint** task:

    * should use `.jshintrc` file
    * should specify all **.js** files from: `app` folder, `test` folder and its **subfolders** to linted, moreover `bower components` should be excluded from checking
    * should detect errors and potential problems in **.js** files and create `jshint.xml` report in `target` folder (use built-in checkstyle reporter),

* **karma** task:    

    * should use `karma.conf.js` configuration file
    * should contain `unit` subtask which runs all tests
    
## Setup

### To install dependencies 

```
yarn install
```

```
bower install
```

### To start application in live reload mode

    grunt serve
    
### Run tests

To run e2e tests in development mode:

    grunt test:e2e


### Before you start, please refer to:
